Q1: I just followed the standard formula for value iteration.

Q3: Learning from Q2, I got the general idea that combination of noise and higher living reward avoids cliffs, while lower discount rate prioritizes the closer reward.

Q4: I followed standard Q Learning formula with Q Learning sample

Q5: If the coin toss goes through, we choose a random action, otherwise, we follow the standard.

Q6: Not possible through experimentation

Q7: Works by default

Q8: Follow the formula for diff and weights given on project page. Interesting use of operator overloading for addition and multiplication. I can find the dot product of counters and add them easily.
